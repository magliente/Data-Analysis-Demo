This project analyzes the official results from the 2024 Pikes Peak 10k race. The analysis emphasizes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleansing, and visualizations to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. The primary focus is on comparing gun times and net times for runners across different divisions and genders. The objective is to visualize these differences, examine the distribution of race times, and investigate the impact of outliers on mean and median times.
